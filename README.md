_simple undo/redo functionality for redux state containers_

**Protip:** You can use the [redux-undo-boilerplate](https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo-boilerplate) to quickly get started with `redux-undo`.

**Note:** Make sure to update your programs to the [latest History API](#history-api).


## Installation

```
npm install --save redux-undo
```

## Making your reducers undoable

`redux-undo` is a reducer enhancer, it provides the `undoable` function, which
takes an existing reducer and a configuration object and enhances your existing
reducer with undo functionality.

**Note:** If you were accessing `state.counter` before, you have to access
`state.counter.present` after wrapping your reducer with `undoable`.

To install, firstly import `redux-undo`:

```js
// Redux utility functions
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
// Redux Undo store enhancer
import undoable from 'redux-undo';
```

Then, add `undoable` to your reducer(s) like this:

```js
combineReducers({
  counter: undoable(counter)
})
```

A [configuration](#configuration) can be passed like this:

```js
combineReducers({
  counter: undoable(counter, {
    limit: 10 // set a limit for the history
  })
})
```


## History API

Wrapping your reducer with `undoable` makes the state look like this:

```js
{
  past: [...pastStatesHere...],
  present: {...currentStateHere...},
  future: [...futureStatesHere...]
}
```

Now you can get your current state like this: `state.present`

And you can access all past states (e.g. to show a history) like this: `state.past`


## Undo/Redo Actions

Firstly, import the undo/redo action creators:

```js
import { ActionCreators } from 'redux-undo';
```

Then, you can use `store.dispatch()` and the undo/redo action creators to
perform undo/redo operations on your state:

```js
store.dispatch(ActionCreators.undo()) // undo the last action
store.dispatch(ActionCreators.redo()) // redo the last action
```


## Configuration

A configuration object can be passed to `undoable()` like this (values shown
are default values):

```js
undoable(reducer, {
  limit: false, // set to a number to turn on a limit for the history

  filter: () => true, // see `Filtering Actions` section

  undoType: ActionTypes.UNDO, // define a custom action type for this undo action
  redoType: ActionTypes.REDO, // define a custom action type for this redo action

  initialState: undefined, // initial state (e.g. for loading)
  initTypes: ['@@redux/INIT', '@@INIT'] // history will be (re)set upon init action type
  initialHistory: { // initial history (e.g. for loading)
    past: [],
    present: config.initialState,
    future: [],
  },

  debug: false, // set to `true` to turn on debugging
})
```

### Filtering Actions

If you don't want to include every action in the undo/redo history, you can
pass a function to `undoable` like this:

```js
undoable(reducer, function filterActions(action, currentState, previousState) {
  return action.type === SOME_ACTION; // only add to history if action is SOME_ACTION
})

// or you could do...

undoable(reducer, function filterState(action, currentState, previousState) {
  return currentState !== previousState; // only add to history if state changed
})
```

Or you can use the `distinctState`, `includeAction` and `excludeAction` helpers,
which should be imported like this:

```js
import undoable, { distinctState, includeAction, excludeAction } from 'redux-undo';
```

Now you can use the helper, which is pretty simple:

```js
undoable(reducer, { filter: includeAction(SOME_ACTION) })
undoable(reducer, { filter: excludeAction(SOME_ACTION) })

// or you could do...

undoable(reducer, { filter: distinctState() })
```

... they even support Arrays:

```js
undoable(reducer, { filter: includeAction([SOME_ACTION, SOME_OTHER_ACTION]) })
undoable(reducer, { filter: excludeAction([SOME_ACTION, SOME_OTHER_ACTION]) })
```


## What is this magic? How does it work?

Have a read of the [Implementing Undo History recipe](https://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html) in the Redux documents, which explains in detail how redux-undo works.
